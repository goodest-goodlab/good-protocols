This is a protocol to isolate cell types from mouse testes at different stages of spermatogenesis using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and extract RNA for cell-type specific expression analyses. The protocol includes reagent preparation, mouse dissection, testis dissasociation, some basic instructions for preparing samples to put on the sorter, and some basic instructions for starting RNA extraction after cells have been sorted. The exact sorting protocol may vary depending on the machine used for FACS.
